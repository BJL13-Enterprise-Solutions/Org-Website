Corporate Philosophy   


BJL13 Enterprise Solutions LLCA Public-Benefit Organization for Human-Centered Infrastructure and Equitable Digital Futures


Empowering Equitable Access: BJL13 Enterprise Solutions is a public-benefit limited liability company founded on the principle that equitable access to critical infrastructure—technological, civic, and informational—is essential for individual flourishing and community resilience . We recognize that modern society’s opportunities and well-being increasingly depend on inclusive infrastructure and digital connectivity, a priority echoed in global development goals to reduce inequalities via technology access .


Interdisciplinary Focus: Our work operates at the intersection of public health, digital equity, AI governance, and community empowerment. We build tools and systems that strengthen these domains in tandem, reflecting how digital inclusion can advance civic engagement, healthcare access, economic opportunity, and social services . Our mission is to create, deploy, and sustain human-centered systems that liberate potential, distribute agency, and democratize access to the “tools of power” – whether technological, procedural, or social.


Digital technology overlays onto human lives – a conceptual illustration symbolizing how infrastructure and data reflect social values. Many experts affirm that what we build is not neutral: infrastructure represents social and political choices , and every technical system carries human biases and intentions . Guided by this understanding, we believe that:


- Infrastructure is political — its design determines who participates and who benefits . Every bridge, network, or platform reflects values and power structures in society, distributing advantages to some while marginalizing others.- Access without literacy is not access — digital tools must be comprehensible and usable, not merely available . True inclusion demands digital literacy and procedural literacy; technology only empowers when people can understand and leverage it effectively.- Technology is not neutral — it is a reflection of structural values, priorities, and omissions . From data biases to design decisions, human choices imbue every system; we must intentionally embed fairness and transparency because left unchecked, tech will mirror and amplify societal inequities.- Human-centered systems must be co-designed — solutions should be co-created with the communities they serve, not imposed from above. We prioritize participatory design, respecting local knowledge and ensuring that users have ownership and agency in the tools that impact their lives.


These core beliefs are built on firsthand experiences spanning underserved communities, systems medicine, military service, and queer civic leadership. BJL13’s frameworks are explicitly crafted to resist extractive models of technology. Instead of one-way extraction of data or value, we emphasize circular equity (reinvesting benefits back into communities), open frameworks (transparency and interoperability), and agency-first engineering that puts end-users’ control and dignity at the forefront of design.


At the heart of BJL13’s strategy is a systemic theory of empowerment:  



“Power is the ability to meaningfully alter the conditions of one’s life in accordance with one’s values. Infrastructure—be it legal, technical, bureaucratic, or semantic—is the medium through which power is distributed.”


In practice, this means that shifting the balance of power requires changing the underlying infrastructures. To liberate individuals and communities, one must:


1. Make the hidden rules, systems, and processes visible and understandable. You cannot challenge or change what you cannot see. We develop tools and educational programs to reveal how systems work—from government forms to algorithms—so that people can navigate and scrutinize them.2. Develop alternative infrastructures or modify existing ones to be more equitable. This involves engineering new digital tools, workflows, or frameworks that address gaps and biases. We focus on creating platforms that encode fairness, accessibility, and resilience by design.3. Ensure the infrastructure (old or new) is accessible and governed by the people it serves. We deploy training, open-source initiatives, and community governance models so that marginalized groups can not only use technology, but also influence its evolution.


From this theory, we derive three operational pillars that define our activities:​​​​​​​


Empowering through knowledge: We provide training and tools to foster procedural literacy (understanding how to navigate institutions and bureaucracies) and digital literacy. Our initiatives include:Civic & Policy Education: Curriculum and workshops on civic processes, public health systems, and digital rights – translating complex policies and legal procedures into plain language and actionable steps.Community Training Programs: Partnerships with community colleges, libraries, and nonprofits to teach foundational tech skills, data privacy, and AI literacy to underserved populations (because a bridge’s value lies in who can cross it).Policy Translation Tools: Development of chatbots and guides that turn dense government forms or public-benefit applications into step-by-step, user-friendly experiences, democratizing access to services and information.


Building real toofls for real people: We design and deploy technology that is accessible, open-source, and privacy-respecting, ensuring it serves users rather than exploits them. Key efforts include:AI Agents for Navigation: Development of AI-powered assistants to help individuals navigate government systems, translate bureaucratic language, or mediate access to resources. (For example, an AI agent can guide a user through applying for health benefits or housing assistance, acting as a digital navigator in lieu of an advocate – an approach aligned with emerging public programs deploying digital navigators for services .)Smart Forms & CLI Tools: Creation of smart, multilingual web forms and command-line (CLI) tools that simplify complex tasks (from tax filing to civic data analysis) for both tech-savvy users and those with limited internet access. Every tool is extensively documented and designed with an intuitive onboarding experience.Self-Hosted Solutions: Whenever possible, our applications can be self-hosted by community organizations to ensure local ownership of data. We utilize open standards and modular architectures, allowing others to fork or adapt our software. User agency guides our development process – features are added to empower users, not to trap them in proprietary ecosystems.


Optimizing workflows for public good: We apply systems thinking and engineering rigor to public and civic sectors that are often under-resourced. This means building and integrating infrastructure that frontline workers and institutions can trust. Our projects include:Equitable Infrastructure Stacks: Creation of turnkey digital infrastructure packages (tech “stacks”) tailored for community clinics, legal aid offices, libraries, and local governments. These include secure communication tools, case-management databases, and analytics that improve service delivery without compromising privacy or autonomy.RAG-Based Toolchains: Deployment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI systems – where large language models are combined with verified knowledge bases – to assist frontline staff in retrieving accurate information quickly. For instance, a nurse or case worker can query an AI assistant that pulls from up-to-date policy manuals or medical guidelines, saving time and reducing errors.Dignity-Centered Workflow Design: We re-engineer processes in settings like public health outreach or social services intake, using automation judiciously. The goal is to eliminate drudgery and surveillance overhead, allowing workers to focus on human interaction. Metrics of success include improved client outcomes and staff satisfaction, not just cost efficiency.


Through these pillars, we aim to continually realign technology with the public interest. By focusing on literacy, usability, and systems-level change, we ensure that our innovations do not just solve problems on paper but work in the real world complexities of communities.

Formation and Entity Status: BJL13 Enterprise Solutions LLC is a Missouri-registered, member-operated LLC that has elected a public-benefit purpose in its founding documents. In practical terms, this means our operating agreement codifies that the company exists not only to be financially sustainable, but to produce positive social impact . (Missouri law does not yet provide a statutory “Benefit LLC” status; however, we voluntarily adhere to principles found in states like Delaware’s Public Benefit LLC framework. Our managers are required to balance the member’s pecuniary interests with the best interests of those materially affected by the company’s conduct and with the specific public benefits we promote .) Key details include:  
Entity Type: Private LLC with Public Benefit orientation (PBC-LLC). EIN is assigned and active.Public Benefit Purpose: Declared in operating agreement. General Benefit: To strengthen equitable public systems and civic infrastructures at large. Specific Beneficiaries: Advancing digital literacy, civic empowerment, and technology access for marginalized or underserved communities (e.g. low-income, rural, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ communities). These commitments function akin to a mission lock, guiding our strategy and growth.  
Ethical Governance: We bind ourselves to decision-making practices that prioritize mission over profit, in line with emerging models of ethical entrepreneurship. Concretely:Mission over Short-Term Profit: In any strategic choice, the option that better serves our public-benefit goals will be favored, even if it marginally reduces profit or growth speed. We view financial returns as means to sustain mission, not an end in itself.Human Dignity over Automation-at-all-costs: We integrate automation and AI to augment human effort, not to displace or dehumanize. If a process risks eroding individual dignity or privacy, we redesign it. No technology will be deployed without considering its impact on the people involved.Transparency over Opacity: We commit to a high level of transparency with stakeholders and the public. When efficiency or expedience conflicts with openness, we err on the side of transparency. This includes openly sharing our product roadmaps, research findings, and even failures, so that others can learn or hold us accountable.  
To formalize these values, we maintain an internal “code of community stewardship,” effectively a corporate constitution that all major decisions are measured against. Our long-term vision is to evolve our governance structure as we grow – potentially transitioning into a multi-stakeholder cooperative or establishing a 501(c)(4) affiliate for advocacy work – ensuring that community voices and public-interest values remain at the center of our enterprise.  
  
  
Our offerings span technology development, capacity building, and consulting, all geared toward liberating infrastructure for public benefit. We serve a range of clients and partners, from grassroots organizations and nonprofits to educational institutions and municipal agencies. Below is an overview of our service categories:  
AI agent deployment for service navigation; “smart form” development and automation; CLI-based civic tech tools; self-hosted, privacy-first applications and platforms.  
Workflow streamlining for clinics and social services; grant support (research & writing for public-interest tech grants); community health outreach training; mobile notary and digital documentation services to reduce paperwork barriers.  
Résumé and portfolio development programs for marginalized job-seekers; digital skills workshops (basic to advanced levels); procedural coaching (e.g. how to appeal a public assistance decision, guided by AI tutors); custom chatbot guides for local resources (like a neighborhood-specific “Ask AI” helpdesk).  
Consulting on civic interface design (making public-facing websites/forms user-friendly); deployment of RAG-based knowledge systems within organizations; digital literacy curriculum design for schools and libraries; data ethics and compliance frameworks for institutions adopting AI tools.  
All our services are delivered with a “train-the-trainer” philosophy: whenever possible, we build capacity within the partner organization so that they can maintain and grow the solution independently. We also emphasize documentation and open access – for instance, if we develop a chatbot for a city department, the underlying code and methodology can be shared with other cities under an open license.  
  
  
Strategic Funding Approach: BJL13 Enterprise Solutions LLC welcomes partnership with aligned funders who understand our long-term, impact-driven vision. To maintain our integrity as a public-benefit company, we seek funding mechanisms that support sustainable growth and patient impact, rather than short-term profit extraction. Potential avenues include:  
Public-Benefit Venture Capital: We are open to socially conscious venture capital and impact investors. (Notably, a growing number of venture firms recognize that public-benefit businesses can achieve competitive returns while driving social change . We aim to join the ranks of successful mission-driven ventures proving that profit and purpose can reinforce each other.)Civic Technology Grants: Government or foundation grants targeting digital inclusion, e-government innovation, public health tech, veterans’ transition, and related areas. Our projects align with grant objectives focused on community capacity building and technology for social goodCapacity-Building Contracts: Contracts with municipalities, healthcare systems, or nonprofits to develop and implement custom solutions. We structure these contracts to include training and handoff, ensuring the solution is sustainable post-engagement.Fiscal Sponsorships & Alliances: We are willing to work under fiscal sponsorship for certain grant-funded projects, or to form joint ventures with nonprofits where a hybrid approach (nonprofit advocacy + for-profit development) makes sense. We also explore partnered product co-development, where BJL13 provides the technical build and a nonprofit or public agency provides domain expertise and pilot deployment.  
  
Currently pre-revenue, BJL13 is in a mission-first building phase. Our focus is on product refinement, field testing with early adopters, and establishing credibility through results. Near-term priorities include:Product Stabilization: Ensuring our AI systems and software platforms are robust, secure, and effective in pilot implementations.Deployment Testing: Running limited-scope deployments with selected community clinics, libraries, and local government offices to gather feedback and measure impact.Branding and Outreach: Communicating our story and value proposition clearly to both the communities we aim to serve and to potential partners. This includes compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG for digital tools) and cultural competency in messaging.  
We are not seeking speculative, growth-at-all-costs capital. Instead, we welcome:  
Strategic Investors who have experience with civic innovation or public interest technology and are committed to a “long game.” We value partners who measure success in social impact metrics and stakeholder trust, in addition to financial ROI.Institutional Funders (philanthropic foundations, corporate social impact funds, etc.) that target modernization of public-facing services or bridging the digital divide. We speak the language of both technology and community outcomes, making us an effective vehicle for implementing grant-funded initiatives on the ground.Nonprofit Partners and Cooperatives looking to white-label or fork our tools. In some cases, the best way to scale impact is to let others replicate our work. We offer open-source licensing or low-cost licensing for nonprofits who want to adapt our software to their locale or integrate our training curricula into their programs.  
For investor or partnership inquiries: Please contact us for a detailed capability statement, case studies, or to discuss a tailored collaboration model. (Email: info@bjl13.com)  
  
  
By the end of this decade, BJL13 envisions becoming:  
A Trusted Developer of Civic Tech & AI for Public Services: We aim to be the go-to team that city governments, community health clinics, and educational institutions trust to build human-centric AI solutions. Whether it’s a virtual assistant for a city hall or an open-data platform for a local community, our name should be synonymous with reliability, ethics, and impact.A Training Ground for AI-Literate Community Leaders: Internally and through our partners, we will cultivate a new class of community workers and organizers who are fluent in AI and data. Just as Teach for America built education leaders, BJL13 will help create “digital empowerment fellows” – people who can straddle grassroots work and tech development.A Template for Ethical Tech Enterprises: We intend to demonstrate a successful model of a for-profit LLC that operates with the accountability and transparency of a nonprofit. By documenting our journey and governance evolution, we hope to influence industry norms and policy – showing regulators and peer organizations that AI can be deployed responsibly at scale. (For instance, global guidelines like the OECD’s principles for trustworthy AI state that AI should “benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth… and well-being” , and we strive to embody this ethos in every project.)Importantly, we do not measure our future in typical Silicon Valley terms (user acquisition at any cost, rapid “unicorn” scaling, or data hoarding). We reject growth through surveillance, hype, or exploitation. Instead, we will scale through:Deployment in the Real: Our tools will be judged by real-world uptake and positive outcomes in communities – e.g. how many people obtained services they couldn’t before, or how many hours of bureaucratic runaround were saved. Scaling means expanding these genuine impacts geographically and into new domains.Trust Earned from Below: We will know we are succeeding when community members vouch for us, when a librarian or a case worker recommends our solution to a peer in another city. Trust is our growth engine, and it can only be earned by consistently doing right by the users and communities.Accountability to the Commons: As we grow, we plan to institutionalize community oversight (through advisory boards, open-source contributions, and public reporting). If we ever falter in our mission, these mechanisms will correct our course. We want our model to inspire broader change – proving that a tech company can be answerable to the people, not just shareholders.In summary, our 2030 vision is a company that stands as proof-of-concept for a better tech industry – one where innovation and equity are not at odds, but deeply interdependent. We foresee a future in which our initial projects in Kansas City and the Midwest are replicated internationally, tailoring the approach but keeping the heart of it: liberation through infrastructure.  
  
  
We believe that transparency is a prerequisite to trust. BJL13 therefore commits to open practices in how we build and operate:  
Open-Source Development: Whenever feasible, our software codebases are open-source (or source-available for certain clients’ privacy). We maintain a GitHub organization where active projects, documentation, and issue tracking can be viewed by the public. This invites collaboration and scrutiny – anyone can audit our code for biases or security issues, and many can contribute improvements.Open Knowledge & Research: We publish our research findings, white papers, and even our internal playbooks on topics like “AI Ethics for Small Organizations” or “Community-First Design Principles.” By sharing knowledge, we aim to support a wider ecosystem of civic tech beyond our own projects.Financial Transparency: As a private company, we are not legally required to disclose finances, but we plan to share high-level financial summaries annually (especially how funds are allocated to mission vs. operations). We also disclose sources of funding and key partnerships, so stakeholders know who we are accountable to. (Some proprietary or sensitive details may be redacted to protect privacy or security, but the default is openness.)
