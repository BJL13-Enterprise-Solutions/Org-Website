# Contributing to BJL13.org

First, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. Whether it’s a typo fix, bug report, design critique, or a content suggestion, your effort is appreciated.

This is a **personal site and project**, but it benefits from community awareness and input — especially from those who share a background in public health, queer identity, accessibility, scripting, or ethical tech.

## 📐 Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Try to group related changes into a single PR
- If editing content, preserve tone and intent unless otherwise discussed
- Keep formatting and accessibility in mind (semantic HTML > pretty visuals)

---

## 🧪 Local Dev

Instructions for local setup will be added once the new stack is finalized. Until then, feel free to suggest improvements to static content directly via PR or GitHub web UI.

---

## 📨 Submitting Your PR

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`
2. Submit a pull request with a clear description
3. If it’s a larger or structural change, open an issue first to discuss

---

## 🗯 Code Style / Tools

Until the formal stack is in place, there’s no enforced linter/prettier config. This may change.
