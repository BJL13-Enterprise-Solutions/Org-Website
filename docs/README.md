> “**Breaking the chains of today to set tomorrow free.**”

At BJL13, we believe that **technology must serve liberation**, not bureaucracy. This site embodies our commitment to:

- Documentation as a tool of empowerment

This means you'll find:
- Clearly articulated ethics and anti-exploitation clauses
- Plain-language documentation of rights, expectations, and contacts
- Open-source references for all internal frameworks (when safe to do so)
