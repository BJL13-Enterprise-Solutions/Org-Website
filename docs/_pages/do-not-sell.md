# Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information

Certain U.S. state laws give you the right to opt out of:

- Sale or sharing of your personal information
- Use of your data for targeted advertising

**To opt out**, email us at [privacy@bjl13.com](mailto:privacy@bjl13.com) with the subject:  
`Privacy Opt-Out Request`  
Include your name and contact details.

We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals automatically.

After opting out, you may still see ads — but they won’t be personalized or shared with third parties.
