# Ethics Statement

We commit to:

- ✦ Never contracting with law enforcement
- ✦ Respecting all lived experiences without prejudice
- ✦ Centering those most impacted by structural harm
- ✦ Open-sourcing our most impactful tools whenever possible
- ✦ Building tools for liberation, not surveillance

Our ethics evolve with our community. If you see something misaligned, please let us know.
