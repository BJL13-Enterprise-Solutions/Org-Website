# About BJL13 Enterprise Solutions

BJL13 is a queer- and disability-owned public-benefit LLC headquartered in the Kansas City metropolitan area.

We design ethical, community-first technologies that empower people — not systems. Our focus areas include:

- ✦ Agentic AI for public navigation and advocacy
- ✦ Open infrastructure for marginalized communities
- ✦ Automation tools to streamline public services
- ✦ Digital literacy and public-benefit consulting

Our mission is to transform systems of oppression into structures of liberation.
