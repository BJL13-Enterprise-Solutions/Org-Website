# BJL13.org — Website Codebase

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **official codebase and content** for [BJL13.org](https://bjl13.org) — the professional hub of **BJL13 Enterprise Solutions**. Originally seeded from a direct capture of the legacy `.org` site, this repo now serves as the **canonical source of truth** for future development, iteration, and publishing.

> This code is live-backed, versioned, and actively evolving. No longer a temporary mirror.

---

## 🧠 Origin Story

This repo began as a clean archive of the prior `.org` website to preserve:

- Static content (HTML, Markdown, and embedded data)
- Legacy design/layouts for audit/comparison
- Raw assets: images, downloadable files, old scripts

Since then, it's transitioned into an **active development environment** for a rebuilt, modern site — likely static-first, privacy-respecting, and script-aware.

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- ✅ **Repository is authoritative**
- 🛠️ **Migration to new stack in progress** (e.g., Eleventy, Astro, Hugo, or custom shell-based static site build)
- 🔍 All content under revision for:
  - Accessibility
  - Performance
  - Portability
  - Long-term maintainability

Want to see where it’s going? Track branches like `dev`, `refactor`, or `modern`.

## 🚀 Goals

- Static-first architecture (likely CI-published)
- Source-controlled everything — no CMS lock-in
- Makefile- or shell-driven build system, if applicable
- Local-first authoring and testing
- Accessibility & performance focused
